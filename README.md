# reSushi

reSushi is the opportunity for tech-savvy people,
who come from different cultural backgrounds and
bring along different technical devices,
to look for your favorite food here and now in the big city.
It combines the richness of Ruby technology with the decade-long Japanese tradition of shokuhin sampuru.

The site is subject to Zen's attributes of simplicity as a self-understanding and
independence of word and character. So there is more room for another motto of the Zen:

"I would like to offer something to anyone To help you"

Thus the needs of the target group in the search for good peace are met in a special way.
